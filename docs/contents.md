| On ICS Attachment Creation | This will execute once the attachment get created with tag ICS - Advisory. |
| Create ICS Advisory Record | This reference PB will create an ICS advisory record. |
| On ICS Advisory Creation | This PB get executed once new ICS Advisory is created. |
| Create or Link CVEs | This PB will link existing CVEs with Advisory or will create new CVE. |
| On ICS Advisory Update | This PB will execute when new CVE is found in ICS Advisory. |
| CVE Changes To KEV | When CVE record is updated and changed to KEV, this PB mark related Advisory as KEV. |
| Get Latest Report Of CVEs | This PB will executes on ICS Advisory, CVEs and KEV Alert to fetch latest report of CVEs |
| Get And Update CVE | This PB will get CVE report from NIST-NVD and will update CVE record. |
